CLARITY Pulse V2 - iOS Frontend Rebuild Product Requirements Document

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Complete rebuild of CLARITY Pulse iOS application using SwiftUI and SwiftData. This is a frontend wrapper for the existing backend API with 44 endpoints. The app must follow strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices with NO production code written without a failing test first.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Architecture:
- Clean Architecture with 4 distinct layers: UI, Domain, Data, Infrastructure
- SwiftUI with @Observable pattern (iOS 17+)
- SwiftData for persistence (NOT Core Data)
- Repository Pattern for data abstraction
- Protocol-first design for complete testability
- Dependency injection via SwiftUI Environment
- NO singletons anywhere in the codebase
- Private access control by default

Development Methodology:
- Strict Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for test descriptions
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle mandatory
- Minimum 80% code coverage requirement
- All external dependencies must be mockable
- Human intervention required for Xcode test target configuration

Technology Stack:
- iOS 18.0 minimum deployment target
- Swift 5.10+
- Xcode 16+
- SwiftUI for all UI
- SwiftData for persistence
- AWS Amplify for authentication
- URLSession for networking
- Combine/async-await for reactive programming
