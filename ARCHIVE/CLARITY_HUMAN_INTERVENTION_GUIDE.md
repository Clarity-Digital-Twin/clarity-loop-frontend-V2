## üîÑ INTEGRATION WITH OTHER DOCUMENTS

### In Every Document, Add These Reminders:

#### For SwiftData Documents:
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è HUMAN INTERVENTION: When adding new @Model classes, you MUST:
1. Add the Swift file to Xcode project manually
2. Ensure Core Data model generation is disabled
3. Clean build folder before first run
```

#### For Testing Documents:
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è HUMAN INTERVENTION: All test execution MUST be done in Xcode:
1. AI can write tests but CANNOT run them
2. Use Cmd+U in Xcode for test execution
3. Report specific failures back to AI
```

#### For Security Documents:
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è HUMAN INTERVENTION: Keychain and biometric testing requires:
1. Real device testing (simulator limitations)
2. Manual permission grants
3. Settings.app configuration
```

#### For State Management Documents:
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è HUMAN INTERVENTION: SwiftUI Preview issues require:
1. Xcode preview panel debugging

```

## üìã HUMAN RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### For Successful Operations:
```

- Next: Ready for next step"
```

### For Failed Operations:
```
"FAILED: [Task name]

## üö¶ AI BEHAVIOR RULES

### AI MUST:
1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** when encountering any task above
2. **CLEARLY STATE** what human intervention is needed
3. **WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION** before proceeding
4. **NEVER ASSUME** Xcode operations were successful
5. **REQUEST SPECIFICS** if human response is vague

### AI MUST NOT:
1. Attempt to simulate Xcode operations via CLI
2. Skip testing because it requires human help
3. Proceed past intervention points without confirmation
4. Generate code that requires Xcode without alerting human

## üéØ ENFORCEMENT IN AI PROMPTS

Every AI session should begin with:
```
CRITICAL RULES:
1. This is an iOS app requiring Xcode for many operations
2. You CANNOT run tests - request human to run in Xcode
3. You CANNOT modify project structure - request human Xcode help
4. You CANNOT build/run - request human to use Xcode
5. Read CLARITY_HUMAN_INTERVENTION_GUIDE.md for all stop points
```

## üìä QUICK REFERENCE CARD

## üîÑ CONTINUOUS REMINDERS

Insert these reminders throughout implementation:

```swift
// ‚ö†Ô∏è HUMAN INTERVENTION: After creating this file, add it to Xcode project

// ‚ö†Ô∏è HUMAN INTERVENTION: Run these tests in Xcode with Cmd+U

// ‚ö†Ô∏è HUMAN INTERVENTION: Test this on real device, not simulator

// ‚ö†Ô∏è HUMAN INTERVENTION: Check Xcode console for actual error
```

**Remember**: The success of this project depends on clear AI-Human collaboration. When in doubt, STOP and ASK for human help!
