3. **Backend Integration**: All 44 endpoints implemented
4. **Offline First**: Every feature works offline
5. **HIPAA Compliance**: Security throughout

## Usage Instructions

### For AI Agents
```bash
# Start with the next available task
task-master next

# Work on a specific task
task-master set-status --id=1 --status=in-progress

# Complete a task
task-master set-status --id=1 --status=done

# Expand complex tasks
task-master expand --id=2 --num=10
```

### Progress Tracking
```bash
# View all pending tasks
task-master list --status=pending

# Check completed work
task-master list --status=done

# Find blocked tasks
task-master list --status=pending | grep "blocked"
```

## Human Intervention Required

These tasks require human interaction:
- Task 1: Create Xcode project
- Task 142: Add Watch App target
- Task 165: Certificate configuration
