# Wave 2 Task 6: APIClient TDD Refactoring ✅

## Date: June 28, 2025

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary
Successfully refactored the APIClient architecture using TDD methodology. All tests are passing and the codebase maintains a green baseline.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **RequestBuilder** (78 lines)
- Extracted URL construction logic from NetworkService
- Handles query parameters, headers, and request body
- Provides clean separation of concerns
- Conforms to Sendable for thread safety

#### 2. **RetryStrategy** (129 lines)
- Protocol-based retry strategy design
- `ExponentialBackoffRetryStrategy` with configurable parameters
- Smart retry decisions based on error types
- Supports rate limiting with server-provided delays
- Jitter added to prevent thundering herd

#### 3. **ErrorResponseParser** (132 lines)
- Robust error parsing from multiple response formats
- Supports 5 different error response structures:
  - `{ "error": "message" }`
  - `{ "message": "message" }`
  - `{ "errors": [{ "message": "message" }] }`
  - `{ "detail": "message" }`
  - Plain text responses
- Clean error mapping to NetworkError types

#### 4. **NetworkService Improvements**
- Cleaner architecture with dependency injection
- Retry logic integrated into request flow
- Better error handling with ErrorResponseParser
- Reduced from 215 to 149 lines (31% reduction)

### Test Results
```
Test Suite 'APIClientTests' passed
Executed 6 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 0.005 seconds
```

### Architecture Benefits
1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Easy to mock and test individual components
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new retry strategies or error formats
4. **Performance**: Retry logic with exponential backoff prevents server overload
5. **Reliability**: Better error handling and automatic retries for transient failures

### Commit Details
- Commit SHA: f93eca1
- Files changed: 4 (3 new, 1 modified)
- Lines added: 339
- Lines removed: 128
- Net change: +211 lines (but cleaner architecture)

### Next Steps
Wave 2 Task 7: Add-Metric flow (FAB → sheet → POST)
