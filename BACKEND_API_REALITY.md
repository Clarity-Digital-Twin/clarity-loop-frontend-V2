# Backend API Reality Check

## What The Backend ACTUALLY Provides

After auditing `/BACKEND_REFERENCE`, here's what your backend really does:

### 1. Authentication (AWS Cognito - NOT Custom JWT!)
```python
# Backend uses AWS Cognito
auth_endpoints = {
    "POST /auth/register": "AWS Cognito user pool registration",
    "POST /auth/login": "Returns Cognito tokens (id, access, refresh)",
    "POST /auth/refresh": "Cognito token refresh",
    "POST /auth/logout": "Cognito session invalidation",
    "GET /auth/verify-email": "Cognito email verification"
}
```

### 2. Health Data Management
```python
health_endpoints = {
    # Metrics CRUD
    "POST /health/metrics": "Create single metric (deprecated)",
    "POST /health/metrics/batch": "Batch upload metrics",
    "GET /health/metrics": "Query with filters (type, date range)",
    "GET /health/metrics/summary": "Aggregated stats",
    
    # HealthKit Integration
    "POST /health/healthkit/upload": "Bulk HealthKit data",
    "GET /health/sync/status": "Check sync status",
    
    # Real-time Streaming
    "WS /health/stream": "Real-time health updates"
}
```

### 3. AI Analysis (PAT + Gemini)
```python
ai_endpoints = {
    # PAT Analysis
    "POST /analysis/pat/predict": "Movement pattern analysis",
    "POST /analysis/pat/batch": "Bulk movement analysis",
    "GET /analysis/pat/reports": "Historical analysis",
    
    # Gemini Chat
    "POST /ai/chat": "Natural language health Q&A",
    "POST /ai/insights/generate": "Automated insights",
    "GET /ai/conversations": "Chat history",
    
    # Async Processing
    "GET /jobs/{job_id}": "Check analysis status"
}
```

### 4. WebSocket Events
```python
websocket_messages = {
    # Server -> Client
    "health_metric_update": {"metric_type", "value", "timestamp"},
    "analysis_complete": {"job_id", "result_url"},
    "insight_generated": {"insight_id", "summary"},
    "sync_status": {"status", "progress", "errors"},
    
    # Client -> Server
    "subscribe_metrics": {"types": ["heart_rate", "steps"]},
    "start_analysis": {"data_range", "analysis_type"},
    "chat_message": {"message", "context"}
}
```

### 5. Data Models (What Frontend Got Wrong)

#### User Model
```python
# Backend expects
{
    "id": "cognito-uuid",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "profile": {
        "display_name": "John Doe",
        "timezone": "America/New_York",
        "health_goals": []
    }
}

# Frontend sends
{
    "uid": "custom-id",  # WRONG
    "username": "user",  # DOESN'T EXIST
    "role": "user"       # NOT USED
}
```

#### Health Metric
```python
# Backend expects
{
    "user_id": "cognito-uuid",
    "metric_type": "heart_rate",  # Enum
    "value": 72.5,
    "unit": "bpm",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "source": "apple_watch",
    "metadata": {}
}

# Frontend sends
{
    "localID": "uuid",        # NOT NEEDED
    "type": "heartRate",      # WRONG ENUM
    "syncStatus": "pending"   # CLIENT-ONLY
}
```

### 6. Security & Compliance

#### What Backend Provides
- AWS Cognito MFA
- API Gateway auth
- CloudWatch audit logs
- S3 encrypted storage
- HIPAA-eligible infrastructure

#### What Frontend Missing
- Proper token handling
- Audit log integration
- Local encryption
- Secure storage
- Privacy controls

### 7. The Shocking Misalignments

1. **Frontend built for custom auth, backend uses AWS Cognito**
2. **Frontend WebSocket expects custom protocol, backend uses standard Socket.IO**
3. **Frontend data models don't match ANY backend DTOs**
4. **Frontend missing entire AI analysis features**
5. **Frontend has no job/async operation handling**

## The Reality

Your backend is actually quite sophisticated:
- Proper AWS infrastructure
- Advanced AI capabilities (PAT + Gemini)
- Real-time streaming
- Async job processing
- HIPAA-eligible setup

But your frontend was built on completely wrong assumptions about the API.

## Why This Happened

Looking at the code, it seems like:
1. Frontend started before backend was finalized
2. No API contract (OpenAPI) was used
3. Frontend devs guessed at the API structure
4. No integration tests to catch mismatches
5. 489 fake tests hiding the problems

## The Path Forward

1. **Use the OpenAPI spec** - Backend has it, generate DTOs
2. **Match the auth flow** - AWS Cognito, not custom JWT
3. **Implement real features** - AI analysis, async jobs
4. **Test against real API** - Not mocks that lie
5. **Build for production** - HIPAA compliance from day 1

The backend is good. The frontend just needs to actually use it correctly.
