# CLARITY Backend API Audit Summary

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis of the BACKEND_REFERENCE directory, I've identified significant misalignments between what the iOS frontend is attempting to implement and what the backend actually provides. The backend is a sophisticated health data platform with AI-powered analysis capabilities, but the frontend implementation appears to be making incorrect assumptions about API contracts and authentication flows.

## Backend Actual Capabilities

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Provider**: AWS Cognito (NOT custom JWT)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration with email verification
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - Returns JWT tokens from Cognito
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - Session invalidation
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/confirm-email` - Email verification
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset flow
  - `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Get current user info
  - `PUT /api/v1/auth/me` - Update user profile
- **Token Format**: AWS Cognito JWTs with JWKS validation
- **Session Management**: DynamoDB-backed sessions

### 2. **Health Data Management**

  - `GET /api/v1/healthkit/categories` - Get supported data types
- **Supported Types**: Heart rate, sleep analysis, steps, activity, HRV
- **Processing**: Batch upload with async processing

### 4. **AI Analysis Features**
- **PAT (Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer)**:
  - `POST /api/v1/pat/analysis` - Run PAT analysis on movement data
  - `GET /api/v1/pat/status/{analysis_id}` - Check analysis status
  - `GET /api/v1/pat/results/{analysis_id}` - Get analysis results
  - `POST /api/v1/pat/batch` - Batch analysis
  - `GET /api/v1/pat/models` - Available model versions
- **Gemini AI Insights**:
  - `POST /api/v1/insights` - Generate health insights
  - `POST /api/v1/insights/chat` - Interactive AI chat
  - `GET /api/v1/insights/summary` - Daily/weekly summaries
  - `GET /api/v1/insights/recommendations` - Personalized recommendations
  - `GET /api/v1/insights/trends` - Health trends analysis
  - `GET /api/v1/insights/alerts` - Health alerts

### 5. **Real-time Features (WebSocket)**
- **Endpoint**: `ws://[host]/api/v1/ws`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token in connection header
- **Message Types**:
  - Chat messages for AI interaction
  - Health insights delivery
  - Analysis progress updates
  - Real-time health data streaming
  - Connection management (heartbeat, typing indicators)
- **Data Flow**: Bidirectional with structured message formats

### 6. **HIPAA Compliance & Security**
- **Current Implementation** (~30% complete):
  - ✅ AWS Cognito authentication
  - ✅ JWT token validation
  - ✅ PII sanitization in logs
  - ✅ S3 server-side encryption
  - ✅ HTTPS enforcement via AWS ALB
  - ❌ Field-level encryption for PII
  - ❌ DynamoDB encryption at rest
  - ❌ Audit logging for data access
  - ❌ MFA implementation
  - ❌ Rate limiting

## Frontend Misalignments

### 1. **Authentication Issues**
- Frontend expects custom JWT implementation
- Backend uses AWS Cognito with specific token format
- Missing email verification flow
- Incorrect token refresh implementation

### 2. **API Contract Mismatches**
- Frontend sending different data structures than expected
- Missing required fields in requests
- Incorrect endpoint paths
- Wrong HTTP methods for some operations

### 3. **WebSocket Implementation**
- Frontend not implementing proper message type handling
- Missing heartbeat/keepalive mechanism
- Incorrect authentication headers
- Not handling all message types

### 4. **Data Model Discrepancies**
- Frontend models don't match backend DTOs
- Missing required fields
- Incorrect data types
- No support for async processing workflows

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Refactor Existing Code (NOT Recommended)
The current frontend implementation has fundamental architectural misalignments that would require extensive refactoring:
- Complete authentication system rewrite
- All API service implementations need updating
- Data models need to be redesigned
- WebSocket implementation needs complete overhaul

### Option 2: Start Fresh with TDD (RECOMMENDED)
Given the scope of misalignments, starting fresh with Test-Driven Development would be more efficient:

1. **Generate Swift Models from OpenAPI**
   - Use the provided `openapi-cleaned.yaml` to generate accurate models
   - Ensures type safety and contract compliance

2. **Implement Authentication Layer First**
   - Build AWS Cognito integration with proper token handling
   - Implement email verification flow
   - Add biometric authentication on top

3. **Build API Services with Tests**
   - Write tests first based on actual API contracts
   - Implement services to pass tests
   - Use mock data for offline development

4. **Implement WebSocket Properly**
   - Use the documented message types
   - Implement connection lifecycle management
   - Add proper error handling and reconnection

5. **Add HIPAA Compliance Features**
   - Implement secure storage with encryption
   - Add audit logging
   - Ensure no PHI in logs
   - Implement data retention policies

## Critical Backend Features to Leverage

1. **PAT Analysis** - Powerful AI model for movement data analysis
2. **Gemini Integration** - Natural language health insights
3. **Async Processing** - All heavy operations are async with status tracking
4. **Batch Operations** - Support for bulk data uploads
5. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket for live health monitoring

## Security Considerations

The backend is pre-production with only ~30% security implementation. The frontend must:
- Never log sensitive health data
- Use secure storage for all health information
- Implement certificate pinning for API calls
- Add jailbreak detection
- Use biometric authentication for sensitive operations

## Next Steps

1. **Decision**: Refactor vs. Rewrite
2. **If Rewriting**:
   - Set up OpenAPI code generation
   - Create test suite based on API documentation
   - Implement authentication layer
   - Build services incrementally with tests
3. **Timeline**: Fresh implementation would take ~2-3 weeks vs. 4-6 weeks for refactoring

## Conclusion

The backend provides a robust, AI-powered health data platform with sophisticated analysis capabilities. However, the current frontend implementation has fundamental misunderstandings of the API contracts and authentication flow. A fresh start with proper API contract adherence would deliver a more maintainable and correct implementation faster than attempting to refactor the existing code.
