# Clarity Digital Twin Backend - Security Hardening PRD

## Executive Summary

Implement comprehensive security hardening for the Clarity Digital Twin backend to prevent financial risks from automated attacks, secure AWS infrastructure, and establish production-ready security posture before frontend launch.

## Problem Statement

Our ALB hostname is publicly discoverable by automated scanners. While current security vulnerabilities in dependencies have been resolved, we lack critical security controls that could lead to:

1. **Financial Risk**: Automated bot signup spam causing MAU billing explosion and SMS/email verification costs
2. **Security Risk**: Brute-force attacks, DDoS potential, and inadequate security headers
3. **Compliance Risk**: Missing HIPAA-ready security controls for health data processing

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Immediate Financial Protection**: Prevent cost explosion from automated attacks
2. **Infrastructure Security**: Implement AWS-native security controls (WAF, Cognito configuration)
3. **Application Security**: Add security middleware with proper headers, rate limiting, and CORS hardening
4. **Testing & Deployment**: Ensure all changes are properly tested and deployed to AWS

### Success Metrics
- Zero unauthorized user registrations
- Rate limiting blocks > 100 requests/5min per IP
- Security headers pass Mozilla Observatory scan
- All tests pass with 100% backward compatibility
- Successful AWS deployment with no downtime

## Technical Requirements

### 1. AWS Cognito Security Hardening
- **Disable self-signup** in Cognito User Pool to prevent automated user creation
- **Configure account lockout policies** (5 failed attempts, 15-minute lockout)
- **Enable advanced security features** (adaptive authentication, risk detection)
- **Audit existing user pool configuration** for security gaps

### 2. AWS WAF Implementation
- **Rate limiting rule**: Block IPs exceeding 100 requests per 5 minutes
- **Geographic restrictions**: Block traffic from high-risk countries (optional)
- **Common attack protection**: SQL injection, XSS, known bad inputs
- **Bot control**: Basic bot detection and filtering
- **Integration with ALB**: Attach WAF to existing Application Load Balancer

### 3. Application Security Middleware
- **Security headers middleware**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **Rate limiting middleware**: Per-user and per-IP limits for authenticated endpoints
- **CORS hardening**: Replace `allow_origins=["*"]` with specific domains
- **Request size limits**: Prevent large payload attacks
- **Error handling security**: Ensure no sensitive data leaks in error responses

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- **DynamoDB encryption at rest**: Enable customer-managed KMS encryption
- **S3 bucket security audit**: Verify encryption and access policies
- **IAM role audit**: Implement least-privilege access
- **VPC security groups**: Audit and tighten network access rules

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting
- **WAF metrics**: Monitor blocked requests and attack patterns
- **Authentication alerts**: Failed login attempts, suspicious patterns
- **Cost monitoring**: Set up billing alerts for unexpected MAU/SMS spikes
- **Security dashboards**: CloudWatch dashboard for security metrics

## Technical Stack Requirements

### Backend Framework
- **FastAPI**: Existing framework, add security middleware
- **Python 3.11+**: Current version, maintain compatibility
- **Dependencies**: All security vulnerabilities already resolved

### AWS Services
- **AWS WAF v2**: For application firewall and rate limiting
- **Amazon Cognito**: Enhanced configuration, no migration needed
- **AWS CloudWatch**: For monitoring and alerting
- **AWS KMS**: For encryption key management
- **AWS Systems Manager**: For secure parameter storage

### Security Libraries
- **slowapi**: For application-level rate limiting
- **python-jose**: Already updated to secure version (3.5.0)
- **cryptography**: Current version maintained
- **structlog**: Enhanced security logging

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Immediate Protection (Tonight)
1. Disable Cognito self-signup via AWS Console
2. Create and attach basic WAF rate limiting rule
3. Quick CORS hardening for known domains
4. Deploy and verify protection

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Security (Tomorrow)
1. Implement security headers middleware
2. Add application-level rate limiting with slowapi
3. Enhanced WAF rules (bot protection, geo-blocking)
4. DynamoDB encryption configuration
5. Comprehensive testing suite

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Compliance
1. Security monitoring dashboard
2. Automated alerting setup
3. Security audit logging
4. HIPAA compliance documentation

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Maintain existing JWT token validation
- Enhance session management security
- Add suspicious activity detection
- Implement account lockout protection

### Data Protection
- Enable encryption at rest for all data stores
- Implement field-level encryption for PII
- Secure API key management with AWS Secrets Manager
- Audit data access patterns

### Network Security
- WAF protection against common attacks
- Rate limiting at multiple layers (WAF + application)
- Secure HTTPS enforcement (already implemented via ALB)
- VPC security group optimization

### Compliance
- HIPAA-ready logging and audit trails
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Access control documentation
- Security incident response procedures

## Testing Requirements

### Automated Testing
- **Unit tests**: All new middleware and security functions
- **Integration tests**: Authentication flows with new security controls
- **Security tests**: Rate limiting, header validation, error handling
- **Performance tests**: Ensure security middleware doesn't impact performance

### Manual Testing
- **Penetration testing**: Basic automated attack simulation
- **WAF testing**: Verify rate limiting and blocking rules
- **User experience**: Ensure legitimate users are not impacted
- **Monitoring verification**: Confirm all alerts and dashboards work

### Deployment Testing
- **Staging deployment**: Full security configuration in staging environment
- **Production deployment**: Blue-green deployment with rollback plan
- **Post-deployment verification**: Security scan and functionality check

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Authentication failures for legitimate users
- Application performance degradation > 20%
- False positive rate limiting blocking valid traffic
- Any AWS service failures or misconfigurations

### Rollback Procedures
1. **WAF rollback**: Disable or modify rules via AWS Console
2. **Application rollback**: Previous Docker image deployment
3. **Cognito rollback**: Re-enable self-signup if needed
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts during rollback process

## Cost Considerations

### AWS Costs
- **WAF**: ~$5-10/month for basic rules and requests
- **CloudWatch**: ~$2-5/month for additional metrics
- **KMS**: ~$1/month per key for encryption
- **Cognito**: No additional cost for security features

### Operational Costs
- **Development time**: 1-2 engineer days
- **Testing time**: 4-6 hours comprehensive testing
- **Deployment time**: 2-3 hours with verification

### Cost Savings
- **Prevented MAU spam**: Potentially hundreds of dollars monthly
- **Prevented SMS/email costs**: $0.0075 per SMS, $0.10 per email
- **Prevented DDoS costs**: ALB data processing savings
