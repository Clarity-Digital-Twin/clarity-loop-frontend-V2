# Git Commit Split Strategy

## Problem
The commit `9a8b35e` contains:
- 24,518 line changes total
- 24,131 lines are a mistakenly committed build log (ClarityPulseWrapper/Makefile)
- ~387 lines of actual feature code

## Strategy

Since we're on the main branch and the commit has already been pushed, we cannot rewrite history. Instead, we'll:

1. **Remove the accidental build log**
   - Delete ClarityPulseWrapper/Makefile
   - Commit with message: "fix: remove accidentally committed build log"

2. **Document the actual changes from the mega-commit**
   - DashboardViewModel.swift: Added previousValueFor() method
   - DashboardView.swift: Enhanced UI with icons, trends, FAB
   - DashboardViewTests.swift: Added comprehensive test suite

## Future Prevention

1. **Update .gitignore**
   - Add pattern for generated build logs
   - Add Makefile in wrapper directory

2. **Pre-commit hooks**
   - Already implemented SwiftLint checks
   - Could add file size check to prevent large accidental commits

## Implementation Steps

1. Remove the build log file
2. Update .gitignore
3. Commit the cleanup
4. Document in CLARITY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
