# Note: Swift doesn't have built-in performance testing like XCTest's measure blocks in SPM
# This script sets up the infrastructure for when performance tests are added

# When performance tests are implemented, they should:
# 1. Use XCTest's measure blocks for timing critical operations
# 2. Test memory usage for key operations
# 3. Monitor CPU usage during intensive tasks
# 4. Establish baselines for:
#    - Login flow completion time
#    - Health data sync operations
#    - UI rendering performance
#    - Database query performance

# Example performance test structure:
